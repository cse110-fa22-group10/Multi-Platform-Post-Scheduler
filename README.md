# Multi-Platform Post Scheduler

## Project Description

<span style="font-size: 16px">

This project creates a method in which individuals, particularly social-media managers, can plan social media posts on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. 


It acts solely as a planner, the individual must still post the planned items themselves.
