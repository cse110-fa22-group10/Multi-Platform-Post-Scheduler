# Creation Page Structure

## Context and Problem

Currently, the project is structured such that all platform posts are created on one page. But each platform has different requirements, forms, and styling. Should we then split the page into three, one for each platform?

## Considered Options

* One Page
* Three Pages
  
## Decision Outcome

Chose three pages by majority vote since it will be more efficient, with no need to create a dropdown that shifts between HTML and CSS.
