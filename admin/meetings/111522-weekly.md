    - End is right after end of sprint
    - Goal becomes implementing CRUD functionality on backend
  - Everyone is free to make issues as they see fit
    - One ticket per pair
  - Things that need to get done for sprint:
    - Add JSDocs comment to every JS file so docs can generate
      - Buwei (Will) will talk about the format, and ask if everyone is ok 
    - Should post creation page be the same page that changes functionality, or three different pages with different forms and constraints?
      - Poll was 50-50, Charles broke tie and said it should be 3 pages
  - Pairs were setup
  - Code Review should fall on the writers and not necessarily code reviewers 

## Decisions
- Three page post creation
  - Less code, not overengineering with dropdown and updating
