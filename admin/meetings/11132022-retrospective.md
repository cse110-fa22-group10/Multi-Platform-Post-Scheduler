## Agenda
- Agile Retrospective via Retrium
  - Major Items
    1. Lack of communication
    2. Teams are not very formed, so pairs would be the best way within the frontend/backend framework
    3. Prototypes were good
    4. Issues were not closed or reviewed

## Decisions
- Communicate more with teams
- Teams will become more defined
