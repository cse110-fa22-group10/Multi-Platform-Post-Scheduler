## Agenda
- Agile Retrospective via Retrium
  - Major Items
    1. Lack of communication
    2. Organizations of teams are not well formed, so the subgroup is needed to promote collaboration between group member and pairs would be the best way within the frontend/backend framework
    3. Prototypes or the drawing design of the appearance and overall structure of the website in figma.com were good
    4. Issues were not clear formatted which makes the purpose of TODO blurred to others or reviewed

## Decisions
- Communicate more within the team
- Teams will become more defined
- Set up Pairing of each member from backend group and frontend group as stated in the agenda
- Enforce the number of issues solved to get everybody engaged with the project development
