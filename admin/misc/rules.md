## Expectations on Communication and Meetups

Questions and logistics should be responded to within a day, preferably as soon as possible

on weekends, it should still hold when deadlines are in the midst

trying to respond when you can — even if you don’t know if you can make a time, let the team know that you saw the message and you’ll get back to them later
at least acknowledge you saw it
(ex. emoji reactions, just add a thumbs up or something)

1 mandatory(?) meeting, 8pm  one optional?

Keep up to date with geekbot

Questions and logistics should be responded to within a day, preferably as soon as possible
on weekends, it should still hold when deadlines are in the midst
Try to make it to at least one meeting, out of the two meetings throughout the week. Such that one meeting is required and the other meeting is optional. Preferably, we should make as many meetings to get work done, or to eliminate any confusion. It is best to attend meetings to stay on top of work.

## Meeting Schedule
Required(?) Tuesday 11:00AM-12:00PM, Discussion time

## Responsibilities for Everyone
Good code documentation

Responding to the standup bot

Respecting each other

## Responsibilities by Role

olsen, Jennifer: maybe frontend, working with html, css, javascript

backend: managing databases, get, post requests

team lead: guides towards the weekly long term and short term decisions. 

## Conflict Resolution

When conflict arises, it is best to analyze the situation, deescalate while avoiding further escalation
Understanding that everyone is dealing with a human experience, is the best way to grasp different points of views, while avoiding conflict.

Respect each others space, while maintaining a professional environment.
Frustrations, concerns, and any other external factors that can cause conflict should be communicated thoroughly to team leads to ensure the best conflict resolution can be applied


Implementation wise: list out pros cons, do a poll, pick majority option
