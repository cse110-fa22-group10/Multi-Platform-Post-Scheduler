## Expectations on Communication and Meetups

**Communication**
- Questions and logistics should be responded to within a day, preferably as soon as possible
  - On weekends, it should still hold when deadlines are in the midst
- Acknowledge messages when you can 
  - This could look like: adding an emoji reaction or letting the team know that you have to get back to them later

**Meetups**
- Tuesday 11:00AMâ€”12:00PM required weekly meeting
- Wednesday 8:00-8:50PM meeting is optional
- Try to make it to at least one meeting, out of the two meetings throughout the week. Such that one meeting is required and the other meeting is optional. Preferably, we should make as many meetings to get work done, or to eliminate any confusion. It is best to attend meetings to stay on top of work.

## Meeting Schedule

- Required: Tuesday 11:00AM-12:00PM
- Optional: Wednesday 8:00-8:50PM

## Conflict Resolution

- When conflict arises, it is best to analyze the situation, deescalate while avoiding further escalation.
- Understanding that everyone is dealing with a human experience, is the best way to grasp different points of views, while avoiding conflict.
- Respect each others space, while maintaining a professional environment.
- Frustrations, concerns, and any other external factors that can cause conflict should be communicated thoroughly to team leads to ensure the best conflict resolution can be applied
- When it comes to disagreements regarding implementation and design choices, list out pros cons, do a poll, and pick the majority option.
